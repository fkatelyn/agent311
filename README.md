# agent311

An AI agent for exploring Austin 311 service request data. Ask questions in plain English, get charts, summaries, and insights about city services in Austin.

## What You Can Do

Talk to the agent like you're chatting with a data analyst. Here are some things to try:

**Get the data**
> "Download the last month of 311 data"
> "Fetch 311 requests from the past 3 months"

**Explore it**
> "What are the most common complaints in Austin?"
> "Show me a breakdown by department"
> "Which neighborhoods generate the most 311 requests?"
> "What day of the week has the most requests?"

**Visualize it**
> "Make a chart of request types"
> "Show trends over time"
> "Compare response rates by district"

**Check resolution**
> "What's the resolution rate for pothole complaints?"
> "How long does it take to resolve a missed trash pickup?"

## Built-in Skills

**Download 311 Data** — Fetches real service request data from the City of Austin Open Data Portal. Ask for any date range, filter by department or ZIP code.

**Analyze 311 Data** — Runs exploratory analysis on downloaded data: top request types, busiest days and hours, resolution times, open vs. closed rates, and more.

**Visualize** — Automatically creates interactive charts whenever the answer involves numbers. Opens them in your browser. Can also produce ASCII charts if you prefer the terminal.

**Resolution Rate** — Given any type of 311 complaint, shows the historical resolution rate for that category, why some don't get resolved, and tips to improve your odds.

**Estimate Resolution Time** — Takes any complaint and estimates how long it's likely to take to resolve.
